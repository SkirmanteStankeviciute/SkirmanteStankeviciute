Hi, Iâ€™m @SkirmanteStankeviciute - junior data engineer with a background in banking and a strong focus on building robust technical skills with Python. With a career shift in October 2022, currently I am employed at a Lithuanian tech unicorn. 

I transitioned from a managerial position in banking to the exciting field of data engineering. I leverage my extensive experience in the financial industry to bring a unique perspective to my new role as a data engineer. Having worked in a managerial position, I hold exceptional soft skills that complement my technical expertise. I excel at communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, which enables me bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.

I am committed to expanding my technical knowledge as a data engineer. Python, in particularor building reliable data pipelines and performing advanced data analysis.
