Hi, Iâ€™m @SkirmanteStankeviciute - analytics engineer with a background in banking and a strong focus on building robust technical skills with Python. With a career shift in October 2022, currently I am employed at a Lithuanian tech unicorn. 

I transitioned from a managerial position in banking to the exciting field of data engineering. I leverage my extensive experience in the financial industry to bring a unique perspective to my new role as a data engineer. Having worked in a managerial position, I hold exceptional soft skills that complement my technical expertise. I excel at communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, which enables me bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.

Currently, as Analytics Engineer I am responsible for gathering data from various sources such as databases, APIs, logs, and files and design and maintain data models that support business requirements and analytical needs. Mostly working with dbt core, Airflow to orchestrate robust pipelines and python to implement custom transformations.

Here you can find my portfolio ðŸ“–
